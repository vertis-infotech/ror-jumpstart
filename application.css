/*
 * **************
 * NOTE: This is a copy of the standard application.css generated by rails as of Rails version 3.2
 * If you run into any strange issues because of this, compare this with the original 
 * file saved as application_css_bak. 
 * This file is basically trying to add active_scaffold to standard rails, as per instructions
 * here: https://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold/wiki/getting-started
 * **************
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
